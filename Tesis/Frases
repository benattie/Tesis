There aren't that many ways to destroy a solid steel weapon, but somehow the goblins keep finding new ones.
Ghalma's Warden
The strongest of the pride are measured not by the steel in their hands but by the steel in their souls.
After lightning struck the cliffs, the ore became iron, the iron became steel, and the steel became greaves. The lightning never left.
The strongest walls are made not of stone or steel but of the focused strength of warriors.
All your steel won't protect you if your will is weak.
