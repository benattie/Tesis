abstract = {A rapidly quenched nanocrystalline Hf11Ni89 alloy was produced by melt-spinning. The x-ray phase analysis shows that the as-quenched ribbon consists mainly of nanocrystalline fcc HfNi5 although a small amount of Ni(Hf) solid solution is also detected. The crystallite size distribution and the dislocation structure of the dominant HfNi5 phase were determined by a recently developed method of diffraction profile analysis. In this procedure, by assuming spherical shape and log-normal size distribution of crystallites, the Fourier coefficients of the measured physical profiles are fitted by the Fourier coefficients of well established ab initio functions of size and strain peak profiles. The anisotropic broadening of peak profiles is accounted for by the dislocation model of the mean square strain in terms of average dislocation contrast factors. It was found that the median and the variance of the crystallite size distribution are 3.3 nm and 0.82, respectively. The dislocation density is 3.7x10(16) m(-2) and the character of dislocations is nearly pure screw. The results obtained from x-rays were in good agreement with transmission electron microscopy observations.},

The crystallite size distribution and the dislocation structure are characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) peak profile analysis and the hardness is obtained from depth-sensing indentation tests. Magnesium gradually goes into solid solution during ball milling and after 3 h an almost complete solid solution is attained. With increasing milling time, the Mg concentration in solid solution, the dislocation density and the hardness increase, whereas the crystallite size decreases. A similar tendency of these parameters is observed at a particular duration of ball milling with increasing nominal Mg content.

abstract = {Modern materials science diffractometers are generally equipped with area detectors that allow a high time efficiency to be achieved by simultaneously collecting the scattering pattern over large angular regions. These area-detector-based instruments, however, produce a huge amount of data, especially if they are located at large-scale neutron or synchrotron sources. The software StressTextureCalculator (STeCa) was designed to facilitate fast, easy and automated access to such area-detector data. Its outstanding features are direct calculation of diffraction patterns from different types of area-detector measurements, automatic data treatment and peak fitting using several implemented fit options. The resulting information on intensity, peak shift and broadening can then be exported into several data formats. These in turn can be used as input for a wide range of texture, stress and microstructure analysis software packages without additional prior treatment.},

abstract = {The analysis of structure and texture changes in cold-deformed copper by asymmetric rolling with different coefficient of rolls speed asymmetry R (. R=2-4), was shown in recent paper. The results were compared to ones obtained for cold rolled copper with equal speed of both rolls (. R=1). It was found that the application of asymmetric rolling conditions results in a greater strain hardening than in the case of the classical rolling process (. R=1). The results have revealed that increase of the asymmetry coefficient R value, causes presence of higher fraction of high angle boundaries in as-deformed material structure, suggesting the possibility of occurrence of thermally activated processes of structure recovery or mechanical fragmentation of grains. Texture analysis has shown that application of rolling speed asymmetry results in a significant sharpening of the deformation texture (maximum ODF values were twice higher than for normally rolled samples (. R=1)). In addition, for the variant with the greatest coefficient of rolling speed asymmetry (. R=4), obtained deformation texture was characterized by a relatively low fraction of the typical rolling texture components (the Cu, the Bs, and the S), and significantly increased fraction of the shear texture components. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

@article{Gertsman1996,
abstract = {Increasingly new materials are being used for practical applications. Many of these materials have rather complex crystal structures and investigating their crystallography requires determination of various reference systems. For the grain boundary studies, the coincidence site lattice (CSL) model serves as such a reference system. A general method of the determination of CSL misorientations in any arbitrary crystal lattice is yet to be developed. An earlier perception that a three-dimensional coin-cidence should be rather a rare occurrence in the systems of lower symmetry (other than the cubic and HCP crystals) has been proven to be wrong in many cases (e.g. l-3). Zirconium dioxide, ZrOz, exists in three crystalline phases: monoclinic, tetragonal, and cubic. Cal-culations of the CSL misorientations for the last two lattices and for hexagonal ones using the methods developed in (l-4) represent little difficulty. However, to our knowledge, no procedure for the deter-mination of the CSL misorientations in the monoclinic system has been reported so far. Monoclinic zirconia has the crystallographic space group P2,/c and the following parameters of the unit cell (e.g. 5,6): a = 5.1490 A, b = 5.2133 A, c = 5.3161{\&} and p = 99.228 " . Before discussing possible CSL misorientations in zirconia, let us consider a simple example based on geometric considerations. In any monoclinic crystal (with any lattice parameters) the two symmetri-cal boundaries ialong the (001) and (100) planes must have highly ordered atomic structure. The miso-rientation of the first boundary is described as a rotation of either 180 " around the [ 1001 direction or 180 " around the normal to the (00 1) plane. The misorientation of the second boundary is 180 " [00 1] or 180 " around the normal to the (100) plane. It can be shown that three-dimensional CSLs will exist in both cases if (c{\~{}}{\~{}}{\~{}}cos{\~{}} is a rational number. This example justifies the following approximation of the unit cell in the monoclinic zirconia: a = b = c and cosp = -l/6 (i.e. p = 99.5940). Since we are using this approximation, we are talking about near-CSL but not exact CSL misorientations in this system. Consider the following prismatic cell in the monoclinic crystal structure: (po{\&}[i{\~{}}l],[olo{\~{}}). With the above approximation, this cell is orthogonal with the ratios of the squares of the edge lengths ex-pressed as 5:7:3. Therefore, we can apply the algorithm for calculations of the CSL misorientations in 1247 1248 NEAR-CSL MISORIENTATIONS Vol. 35, No. 11 orthorhombic lattices with rational ratios of squares of the lattice periods (3), which is based on the general vector-quatemion method of misorientation representation (2). This algorithm, when applied to the crystal lattice we are considering here, enables the correct determination of all CSL misorienta-tions, although the reciprocal density of coincidence sites, I, can only be calculated to within some factor, which can be 1, 112 or 2. This is due to the fact that calculations using algorithm (3) give t values for the primitive orthorhombic lattice, but actually our computing cell (@oq,[ioq,[olo]) is base-centered.

abstract = {During the deformation of low carbon steel by cold-rolling, dislocations are created and stored in grains depending on local crystallographic orientation, deformation, and deformation gradient. Orientation dependent dislocation densities have been estimated from the broadening of X-ray diffraction lines measured on a synchrotron beamline. Different cold-rolling levels (from 30{\%} to 95{\%} thickness reduction) have been considered. It is shown that the present measurements are consistent with the hypothesis of the sole consideration of screw dislocations for the analysis of the data. The presented evolutions show that the dislocation density first increases within the ?? fiber (={\{}hkl{\}}{\textless}110{\textgreater}) and then within the ?? fiber (={\{}111{\}}{\textless}uvw{\textgreater}). A comparison with EBSD measurements is done and confirms that the storage of dislocations during the deformation process is orientation dependent and that this dependence is correlated to the cold-rolling level. If we assume that this dislocation density acts as a driving force during recrystallization, these observations can explain the fact that the recrystallization mechanisms are generally different after moderate or large strains.},

The new procedure is illustrated with practical examples of hexagonal metals and some low-symmetry mineral phases.},

abstract = {This paper presents Bingham-NODDI, a clinically-feasible technique for estimating the anisotropic orientation dispersion of neurites. Direct quantification of neurite morphology on clinical scanners was recently realised by a diffusion MRI technique known as neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI). However in its current form NODDI cannot estimate anisotropic orientation dispersion, which is widespread in the brain due to common fanning and bending of neurites. This work proposes Bingham-NODDI that extends the NODDI formalism to address this limitation. Bingham-NODDI characterises anisotropic orientation dispersion by utilising the Bingham distribution to model neurite orientation distribution. The new model estimates the extent of dispersion about the dominant orientation, separately along the primary and secondary dispersion orientations. These estimates are subsequently used to estimate the overall dispersion about the dominant orientation and the dispersion anisotropy. We systematically evaluate the ability of the new model to recover these key parameters of anisotropic orientation dispersion with standard NODDI protocol, both in silico and in vivo. The results demonstrate that the parameters of the proposed model can be estimated without additional acquisition requirements over the standard NODDI protocol. Thus anisotropic dispersion can be determined and has the potential to be used as a marker for normal brain development and ageing or in pathology. We additionally find that the original NODDI model is robust to the effects of anisotropic orientation dispersion, when the quantification of anisotropic dispersion is not of interest.},

abstract = {The broadening of diffraction peaks representing different families of grain orientations has been measured for a number of deformed metals: austenitic stainless steel 316, nickel 200 and the titanium alloy Ti-6Al-4V. These measurements have been compared with predictions that explain differences in broadening in terms of the contrast factor of dislocations via two different approaches. This was done in order to understand the effect the contrast factor has on the results of diffraction peak profile analysis methods and the cause of broadening anisotropy. An approach that considers all grains and orientations to behave similarly was found to be unsuccessful in explaining the large variations of broadening in different peaks. These variations can be explained, and errors reduced, by adopting an approach that uses a polycrystal plasticity model. However, if the plasticity based approach is used to solely calculate changes in the contrast factor, it only partly explains changes in broadening. Instead, factors such as variations in the dislocation density and crystallite size in different orientations, the number of dislocations that are mobile, and the number of edge and screw dislocations need consideration. The way to incorporate these additional factors is difficult, but their contribution to broadening anisotropy can be as important as that of the contrast factor.},

abstract = {Diffraction line broadening is caused by different defects present in crystalline materials: (1) small coherent domains, (2) dislocations, (3) other types of microstrains, (4) twin boundaries, (5) stacking faults, (6) chemical inhomogeneities, and (7) grain-to-grain second-order internal stresses. Line profile analysis provides qualitative and quantitative information about defect types and densities, respectively. Line profiles can broaden, be asymmetric, and be shifted, and these features can be anisotropic in terms of hkl indices. A few thumb rules help qualitative selection of lattice defect types. If the breadths do not increase globally with hkl, the defects are of size type, i.e., either the domain size is small or twinning or faulting, or both, is present. Whenever the breadths increase globally, the defects produce microstrains. Physically based profile functions can be determined for the different defect types and hkl anisotropy. The qualitative input about defect types based on different experimental observations allows ade- quate quantitative evaluation of the densities of different defect types by using physically modeled profile functions.},

abstract = {The deformation mechanisms of binary Ti-Al model alloys (0-13.1 at.{\%} Aluminium) have been investigated with respect to the twinning activity using in-situ loading in combination with neutron diffraction as well as detailed post mortem electron backscatter diffraction analysis. A consistent starting grain size and texture was generated for all alloys promoting tensile twinning during compression testing. Long-wavelength neutron diffraction and selected area diffraction transmission electron microscopy analysis were carried out to detect evidence of Aluminium ordering and Ti3Al formation. It was found that raising the Aluminium content in Titanium does first slightly enhance twinning, with {\{}101¯2{\}}{\textless}101¯1{\textgreater} tensile twinning being by far the dominant type, while the critical residual intergranular strains for twin initiation decreases. This suggests that either the lowering of stacking fault energy by Aluminium or its solute solution strengthening effect are important factors. At around 7 at.{\%} Aluminium a turning point in twinning activity was noticed and a further increase in Aluminium did result in a dramatic loss of twinning activity particularly when the material had been exposed to an additional low temperature age. The dramatic decrease of twinning activity is strongly correlated with increasing evidence of short range ordering and also early signs of Ti3Al-formation in case of the highest Aluminium content. In addition, electron backscatter diffraction analysis revealed that the formation of Aluminium ordered zones do severely hinder growth of twin boundaries.},

abstract = {Al-Cu alloy sheets were rolled at room temperature and at liquid nitrogen temperature to true strain values of 0.69 and 1.38. The microstructural changes and variation in mechanical properties due to the effect of rolling temperature was evaluated. X-ray diffraction line profile analysis was performed to calculate crystallite size, microstrain and dislocation density. Irrespective of the amount of reduction, cryorolled samples exhibited reduced crystallite size along with enhanced lattice strain and dislocation density than room temperature rolled samples. At both the reductions, cryorolled samples exhibited better hardness and strength compared to the room temperature rolled samples and the enhanced properties are attributed to the higher dislocation density of the cryorolled samples. The electron backscatter diffraction results indicated that the grains are submicron in size in rolled conditions. It also revealed that majority of the fraction of special grain boundaries are ??1 boundaries with decreasing tendency of ??3 boundaries. Quantitative contributions of different strengthening mechanisms were performed on the rolled samples and it was observed that significant contribution comes from grain boundary strengthening. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {An inverse Hall-Petch effect has been observed for nanocrystalline materials by a large number of researchers. This effect implies that nanocrystalline materials get softer as grain size is reduced below a critical value. Postulated explanations for this behavior include dislocation-based models, diffusion-based models, grain-boundary-shearing models and two-phase-based models. In this paper, we report an explanation for the inverse Hall-Petch effect based on the statistical absorption of dislocations by grain boundaries, showing that the yield strength is dependent on strain rate and temperature and deviates from the Hall-Petch relationship below a critical grain size. ?? 2007 Acta Materialia Inc.},

The proposed whole powder pattern modelling (WPPM) procedure allows a one-step refinement of microstructure parameters by a direct modelling of the experimental pattern. Lattice parameter and defect content, expressed as dislocation density, outer cut-off radius, contrast factor, twin and deformation fault probabilities), can be refined together with the parameters (mean and variance) of a grain-size distribution. Different models for lattice distortions and domain size and shape can be tested to simulate or model diffraction data for systems as different as plastically deformed metals or finely dispersed crystalline powders.

The effect of pyramidal twinning on X-ray line broadening in hcp metals is fundamentally different from the effect of twinning on close packed planes in face centred cubic (fcc) crystals. Therefore, the usual theoretical descriptions developed previously for fcc crystals cannot be used for pyramidal twinning in hcp crystals. The profile functions of sub-reflections for this type of twinning are derived to be the sum of a symmetrical and an antisymmetrical Lorentzian function. Sub-profile properties are parameterized and the parameter files are incorporated into the convolutional multiple whole profile (CMWP) procedure. The extended procedure, eCMWP, is applied to determine pyramidal twin frequencies together with dislocation densities, active slip systems and crystallite size in Mg deformed at different temperatures, in commercial purity Ti deformed at high temperature and in high-purity Ti deformed at room temperature.},

abstract = {A convolution approach to X-ray powder line-profile fitting is developed in which the line shape is synthesized from the Cu K[alpha] emission profile, the dimensions of the diffractometer and the physical variables of the specimen. In addition to the integrated intensities and 2[theta] positions of the line profiles, the parameters that may be fitted include the receiving-slit width, the receiving-slit length, the X-ray-source size, the angle of divergence of the incident beam, the X-ray attenuation coefficient of the specimen and the crystallite size. This is a self-consistent approach to fitting as the instrumental parameters are usually known by direct measurement. To minimize correlation between refined instrumental parameters, profiles at high and low 2[theta] values should be fitted simultaneously. The Cu K[alpha] emission profile used in this work is based on recent monolithic double-crystal spectrometer measurements that have identified a doublet structure in both the K[alpha]1 and K[alpha]2 components. Fast and accurate convolution procedures have been developed and a mixture of multilinear regression and Gauss-Newton non-linear least squares with numerical differentials is used for fitting the profiles. The method is evaluated by fitting powder diffraction data from well crystallized specimens of MgO and Y3Al5O12 (YAG). Testing has also been carried out by examining the changes in the fitted values after altering various instrumental parameters (e.g. receiving-slit width, detector defocus, receiving-slit length and inclusion of a monochromator).},

In Al-Mg alloys the crystallite size reaches its minimum value at lower strain than the dislocation density saturates.

abstract = {The purpose of this study is to investigate the role of deformation twinning in the strain-hardening behavior of high purity, polycrystalline $\alpha$-titanium in a number of different deformation modes. Constant strain rate tests were conducted on this material in simple compression, plane-strain compression and simple shear, and the true stress ($\sigma$)-true strain ($\epsilon$) responses were documented. From the measured data, the strain hardening rates were numerically computed, normalized by the shear modulus (G), and plotted against both normalized stress and $\epsilon$. These normalized strain hardening plots exhibited three distinct stages of strain hardening that were similar to those observed in previous studies on low stacking fault energy fcc metals (e.g. 70/30 brass) in which deformation twinning has been known to play an important role. Optical microscopy and Orientation imaging microscopy were conducted on samples deformed to different strain levels in the various deformation paths. It was found that the onset of deformation twinning correlated with a sudden increase in strain hardening rate in compression tests. The falling strain hardening rate correlated with saturation in the twin volume fraction. In shear testing a much lower rate of strain hardening was found, at all strains, and this correlated with a lower density of deformation twinning. {\textcopyright} 2003 Acta Materialia Inc.

The grain to grain orientation map was determined by electron back scattering diffraction (EBSD) and this was used for orienting individual grains to produce specific Bragg reflections. Anisotropic X-ray line broadening was evaluated in terms of dislocation densities, the average sub-grain size and slip activity. Slip line traces were evaluated in the EBSD micrographs in correlation with the grain orientation.

abstract = {Zirconium-based components in nuclear power plants are embrittled by precipitates of ?? zirconium hydride, which involves a martensitic-type transformation of the hexagonal ??-Zr lattice into the face-centered cubic Zr sublattice of the hydride. As a result, the hydride precipitates have a complex and heavily distorted internal structure that manifests as broad peaks in X-ray diffraction experiments. By a detailed analysis of the peak widths measured for different crystal planes we have found that most of this broadening is the result of dislocations. The analysis also showed that ??-hydride has very anisotropic mechanical elastic properties, in agreement with ab-initio simulations presented in the literature. Provided with this peak-broadening model, we have quantified dislocation densities within ??-hydrides precipitated in several Zr alloys, by analyzing previously published X-ray diffraction experiments performed at three synchrotron X-ray sources. The specimens investigated correspond to components affected by different hydride embrittling processes, namely: (i) samples from various components, charged in the laboratory with H contents in the ???250??wt ppm range, (ii) laboratory-produced hydride blisters in Zr2.5{\%}Nb pressure tubes; and (iii) Zircaloy-4 specimens machined from cooling channels of Atucha I nuclear power plant after 10 years in-service, containing ???140??wt ppm of equivalent H content and subjected to an estimated fast neutron fluence of ???1022 neutrons/cm2. Results show that dislocations densities in the ??-hydrides are large (5???20??????1015??cm???2) and vary among the different specimens. We also found that dislocations densities in the hydride are proportional to the fraction of hydrides already formed in the matrix, which was interpreted as the effect of matrix hardness in the precipitate structure.},

abstract = {A new Taylor-type polycrystalline model has been developed to simulate the evolution of crystallographic texture and the anisotropic stress-strain response during large plastic deformation of high purity $\alpha$-titanium at room temperature. Crystallographic slip, deformation twinning and slip inside twinned regions were all considered as contributing mechanisms for the plastic strain in the model. This was accomplished by treating the dominant twin systems in a given crystal as independent grains once the total twin volume fraction in that crystal reached a predetermined saturation value. The newly formed grains were allowed to independently undergo further slip and the concomitant lattice rotation, but further twinning was prohibited. New descriptions have been established for slip and twin hardening and the complex coupling between them. Good predictions were obtained for the overall anisotropic stress-strain response and texture evolution in three different monotonic deformation paths on annealed, initially textured samples of high purity $\alpha$-titanium. {\textcopyright} 2006 Acta Materialia Inc.},

We find that the minimum value for the physically allowed rate of heat production is determined by the growth rate, internal entropy, and durability of the replicator, and we discuss the implications of this finding for bacterial cell division, as well as for the pre-biotic emergence of self-replicating nucleic acids.},

abstract = {The formation of strain-induced martensite in AISI 201 austenitic stainless steel was followed by in situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction during tensile testing. Real-time information allowed tracking microstructural changes related to the decomposition of metastable austenite (??) into hcp-??-martensite and bcc-??'-martensite. Approximately 78{\%} of ??'-martensite was found after an equivalent strain of 0.39 and a corresponding elongation of 0.70 in the analyzed region. Microstructural characterization was carried out using electron backscatter diffraction and scanning electron microscopy. The work hardening behavior of each phase was evaluated and a strain partitioning between martensite and austenite was observed. Microstrain in austenite increased with strain whereas it remained nearly unchanged in ??'-martensite during the experiment. At the end of the test, these two phases showed similar values of microstrain. The formation of martensite and the accumulation of defects in austenite are responsible for the overall work hardening behavior. Kernel average misorientation analyses showed very similar values of stored elastic energy in austenite and ??'-martensite. Orientation relationships among the phases close to {\{}111{\}}??//{\{}0002{\}}??//{\{}011{\}}??' and {\textless}110{\textgreater}??//{\textless}1120{\textgreater}??//{\textless}111{\textgreater}??' were found.},

abstract = {In response to the development of new materials and the application of materials and components in advanced technologies, non-destructive measurement methods of textures and residual stresses have gained worldwide significance in recent years. The materials science neutron diffractometer STRESS-SPEC at FRM II (Garching, Germany) is designed to be applied equally to texture and residual stress analyses by virtue of its very flexible configuration. Due to the high penetration capabilities of neutrons and the high neutron flux of STRESS-SPEC it allows a combined analysis of global texture, local texture, strain pole figure and FWHM pole figure in a wide variety of materials including metals, alloys, composites, ceramics and geological materials. Especially, the analysis of texture gradients in bulk materials using neutron diffraction has advantages over laboratory X-rays and EBSD for many scientific cases. Moreover, neutron diffraction is favourable for coarse-grained materials, where bulk information averaged over texture inhomogeneities is needed, and also stands out due to easy sample preparation. In future, the newly developed robot system for STRESS-SPEC will allow much more flexibility than an Eulerian cradle as on standard instruments. Five recent measurements are shown to demonstrate the wide range of possible texture applications at STRESS-SPEC diffractometer. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {A method is proposed for modelling the complete diffraction pattern of fcc polycrystalline materials. The algorithm permits a simultaneous refinement of several parameters related to microstructure and lattice defects responsible for line broadening effects. Linear (dislocations) and planar (stacking faults) defects are considered in detail, together with the effect of size and shape of coherent scattering domains (crystallites). Experimentally observed profiles are modelled by Voigt functions, whose parameters are connected with those describing the dislocation field (dislocation density, outer cut-off radius, average contrast factor), twin and deformation fault probabilities, and domain size, also considering the effect of a symmetrical instrumental profile. Domain shape is assumed spherical, with a lognormal distribution of diameters; however, the approach can be generalised to different shapes and size distributions. The proposed algorithm can be extended to other crystalline structures, and can be used within the Rietveld method or as a Whole Powder Pattern Fitting (WPPF), as in the present work.},

abstract = {Texture measurement with short-wave X-ray synchrotron radiation in the range of [lambda] [asymptotically equal to] 0.1 A is described. The measurements were carried out with the multipurpose diffraction instrument at the high-field wiggler, high-energy beamline BW5 at HASYLAB. The instrument was equipped with an on-line image-plate area detector for diffraction-image registration and a Eulerian cradle for sample orientation. The particular features of texture measurement with the BW5 instrument are: good resolution in the Bragg angle, extremely high angular resolution in crystal orientation (pole-figure angles) and particularly high penetration depth of several millimetres to centimetres, comparable with that of neutrons but at high spatial resolution. Several examples illustrate the particular advantages of this method for texture studies using large or encased samples (in situ studies in complicated environments, such as cryostats, furnaces, vacuum or pressure chambers, with no serious window problems). This allows, among others, non-destructive texture analysis in technological parts and whole components. Because of the extremely high beam intensity (short exposure times) compared with all other methods of texture measurement, the new technique is particularly suited for the study of large sample series (as is often necessary in industrial applications).},

abstract = {The plastic behavior of four pure face-centered-cubic (fcc) metals (Al, Au, Cu and Ni) was studied at room temperature up to a strain value of ???8 achieved by severe plastic deformation. It is shown that at high strains the saturation flow stress and the total dislocation density can be scaled with the melting point, and the deformation process can be regarded as steady-state flow leading to a uniform description of the plastic behavior of these fcc metals at all temperatures. The results suggest that the plastic flow at room temperature of fcc metals processed by severe deformation is primarily attributable to diffusion-controlled and thermally activated processes due to the high concentration of deformation-induced vacancies. ?? 2010 Acta Materialia Inc.

abstract = {Anisotropic strain broadening in X-ray line profile analysis means that the width of diffraction profiles of Bragg reflections is not a monotonous function of the diffraction angle. The lack of a physically sound model makes the interpretation of line broadening and the structure refinement procedure of Rietveld often difficult or even impossible. A simple and straightforward procedure is presented for the rationalisation of anisotropic strain broadening in terms of the anisotropic contrast effect of dislocations or dislocation-like lattice defects. The procedure makes the evaluation of particle size or coherent domain size, and the density and arrangement of dislocations rather simple with a high precision, especially in the case of untextured polycrystals or when dislocation population on the possible slip systems is uniform. Three illustrative examples of severely deformed microcrystalline copper, the Rb3C60 f.c.c. fullerite and a ball-milled iron powder show the effectiveness of the procedure.},

abstract = {A novel X-ray diffraction-based technique for grain-by-grain assessment of dislocation density within polycrystals is applied. The technique discriminates dislocation densities of different slip modes, slip systems and dislocation character. Data which was formerly confined to the transmission electron microscope (TEM) is now available from X-ray diffraction (XRD). In addition, there is a profound statistical advantage of the XRD approach over the traditional TEM-based approach. Over 130 grains were analyzed for one sample of CoTi, which would be a Herculean task on the TEM, requiring dozens of samples as well as numerous hours on the microscope and analysis of the images generated for each sample. The present experiments were performed in about 30 h per sample and the analysis is semi-automated, involving a Monte-Carlo-type algorithm to determine the dislocation structure best representing the single crystal diffraction peak profiles in a polycrystalline aggregate. Conclusive confirmation of a previously suggested explanation for the anomalous ductility of two CsCl structured intermetallic compounds, CoTi and CoZr, is provided: namely, that c, with b =(1 1 0) and(1 1 1), rarely observed in single crystal experiments, are active in nearly every grain. The results call into question the value of employing single crystal deformation experiments alone to understand the deformation behavior of polycrystalline materials. Further, the results re-emphasize that the uniform stress assumption implicit in Schmid factor analysis is a poor one for materials which are highly anisotropic at the single crystal level. {\textcopyright} 2014 Acta Materialia Inc.

Using this relation the dislocation contrast factors have been evaluated numerically and compiled for a number of common hexagonal materials. A procedure is presented to match experimentally determined contrast factor parameters with the numerically obtained parameter values. The procedure can be used as a tool to extract the microstructure from strain anisotropy in terms of Burgers vector populations, dislocation densities, crystallite size and size distributions in hexagonal crystals.

abstract = {The human brain forms a complex neural network with a connectional architecture that is still far from being known in full detail, even at the macroscopic level. The advent of diffusion MR imaging has enabled the exploration of the structural properties of white matter in vivo. In this article we propose a new forward model that maps the microscopic geometry of nervous tissue onto the water diffusion process and further onto the measured MR signals. Our spherical deconvolution approach completely parameterizes the fiber orientation density by a finite mixture of Bingham distributions. In addition, we define the term anatomical connectivity, taking the underlying image modality into account. This neurophysiological metric may represent the proportion of the nerve fibers originating in the source area which intersect a given target region. The specified inverse problem is solved by Bayesian statistics. Posterior probability maps denote the probability that the connectivity value exceeds a chosen threshold, conditional upon the noisy observations. These maps allow us to draw inferences about the structural organization of the cerebral cortex. Moreover, we will demonstrate the proposed approach with diffusion-weighted data sets featuring high angular resolution. ?? 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

This article is intended to give a comprehensive introduction to dislocation theory for the physicist who is not a specialist in crystal plasticity. It begins with a survey of the established theory relating to the geometrical and topological properties of dislocations, the elastic theory of dislocations in a continuum, the atomistic or core properties of dislocations, and the dynamics of moving dislocations. General methods for finding the elastic field of an arbitrary dislocation loop are outlined, and the results of some recent calculations using anisotropic elasticity are summarized. These include the prediction, partially confirmed by experiment, that dislocations in certain ranges of orientation may have negative line tension. The current importance of atomistic calculations of core structure and related problems is emphasized, and the methods available for these calculations are discussed.},

abstract = {Constitutive models for arterial tissue have been an active research field during the last years. The main micro-constituents of blood vessels are different types of cells and the extra-cellular matrix formed by an isotropic high water content ground substance and a network composed of elastin and collagen fibres. Usually the arterial tissue has been modelled as a hyperelastic material within the framework of continuum mechanics, whereas inclusion of structural tensors into constitutive laws is the most widely used technique to introduce the anisotropy induced by the fibres. Though the different existing fibre bundles present a clear preferential direction, the dispersion inherent to biological tissue advices using of constitutive models including representative structural information associated to the spatial probabilistic distribution of the fibres. Lately, microsphere-based models have demonstrated to be a powerful tool to incorporate this information. The fibre dispersion is incorporated by means of an Orientation Density Function (ODF) that weights the contribution of each fibre in each direction of the micro-sphere. In previous works the rotationally symmetric von Mises ODF was successfully applied to the modelling of blood vessels. In this study, the inclusion of the Bingham ODF into microsphere-based model is analysed. This ODF exhibits some advantages with respect to the von Mises one, like a greater versatility and a comparable response to simple tension and equibiaxial tension tests. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The model effectiveness is demonstrated on a ZnO powder pattern exhibiting strongly anisotropic size broadening and pronounced super-Lorentzian peak shapes. Moreover, it is shown how the apparent crystallites can be interpreted in terms of physical models by using ellipsoidal and cylindrical crystallites with lognormal size distributions. This interpretation is critically assessed and it is argued that both simplified physical models and a priori complementary information (obtained by transmission electron microscopy, for instance) are often needed to avoid unstable and non-unique solutions.},

@article{Knox1994,
abstract = {STUDY OBJECTIVE: To validate previously demonstrated spatial clustering of childhood leukaemias by showing relative proximities of selected map features to cluster locations, compared with control locations. If clusters are real, then they are likely to be close to a determining hazard.

DESIGN: Cluster postcode loci and partially matched control postcodes were compared in terms of distances to railways, main roads, churches, surface water, woodland areas, and railside industrial installations. Further supporting comparisons between non-clustered cases and random postcode controls with those map features representable as single grid points were made.

SETTING: England, Wales, and Scotland 1966-83.

SUBJECTS: Grid referenced registrations of 9406 childhood leukaemias and non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, including 264 pairs (or more) separated by {\textless} 150 m, and grid references of random postcodes in equal numbers.

MAIN RESULTS: The 264 clusters showed relative proximities (or the inverse) to several map features, of which the most powerful was an association with railways. The non-railway associations seemed to be statistically indirect. Some railside industrial installations, identified from a railway atlas, also showed relative proximities to leukaemia clusters, as well as to non-clustered cases, but did not "explain" the railway effect. These installations, with seemingly independent geographical associations, included oil refineries, petrochemical plants, oil storage and oil distribution depots, power stations, and steelworks.

CONCLUSIONS: The previously shown childhood leukaemia clusters are confirmed to be non-random through their systematic associations with certain map features when compared with the control locations. The common patterns of close association of clustered and non-clustered cases imply a common aetiological component arising from a common environmental hazard--namely the use of fossil fuels, especially petroleum.},

abstract = {We present a fast and versatile algorithm for the reconstruction of the grain structure from 2d and 3d Electron Back Scatter Diffraction (EBSD) data. The algorithm is rigorously derived from the modeling assumption that grain boundaries are located at the bisectors of adjacent measurement locations. This modeling assumption immediately implies that grains are composed of Voronoi cells corresponding to the measurement locations. Thus our algorithm is based on the Voronoi decomposition of the 2d or 3d measurement domain. It applies to any geometrical configuration of measurement locations and allows for missing data due to measurement errors. The definition of grains as compositions of Voronoi cells implies another fundamental feature of the proposed algorithm--its invariance with respect to spatial displacements, i.e., rotations or shifts of the specimen. This paper also serves as a reference paper for the texture analysis software MTEX, which is a comprehensive and versatile, freely available MATLAB toolbox that covers a wide range of problems in quantitative texture analysis, including the analysis of EBSD data.},

The acceptance of the technique is primarily due to the capability of EBSD to aid the research scientist in understanding the crystallographic aspects of microstructure. There has been considerable interest in using EBSD to quantify strain at the submicron scale. To apply EBSD to the characterization of strain, it is important to understand what is practically possible and the underlying assumptions and limitations. This work reviews the current state of technology in terms of strain analysis using EBSD. First, the effects of both elastic and plastic strain on individual EBSD patterns will be considered. Second, the use of EBSD maps for characterizing plastic strain will be explored. Both the potential of the technique and its limitations will be discussed along with the sensitivity of various calculation and mapping parameters.},

abstract = {A possible source mechanism for non-basal {\textless}c+a{\textgreater} slip dislocations is proposed based on the formation of an attractive junction between glissile {\textless}a{\textgreater} and sessile c dislocations from the prism plane into a pyramidal plane. The driving force for the junction formation, which comes from the long-range elastic interaction between c and {\textless}a{\textgreater} dislocations, is relatively large in most hexagonal close-packed (hcp) metals. Beryllium, which has an unusually low Poisson's ratio, is an exception to this rule. The cross-slip process is energetically unfavorable in Mg and Ti, from a viewpoint of the change in anisotropic elastic line tension, but it becomes favorable in Ti at elevated temperatures above 300??C. Discussion is given on intrinsic stacking fault energies and kinetic aspects of the cross slip. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {A well-organized dislocation structure forms in many polycrystalline metals during plastic deformation. This structure is described qualitatively with no explanation of the quantitative characterization. In this work, the evolution of dislocation structure in commercial purity aluminum is described by means of the excess dislocation density and by quantitative characterization of the cell structure as seen on a plane surface. The measurements were performed on a pseudo-internal surface of a split specimen deformed by channel die deformation. The results show a clear dependence of cell structure formation on orientation of the crystallite with respect to the imposed deformation gradient with the largest excess dislocation density occurring in grains of {\{}0 1 1{\}}[1 2 2] orientation for plane strain deformation. Neighboring grain and non-local effects are shown to be of importance in the type of dislocation structures that evolve. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Copper single crystals of [001] orientation were deformed plastically in tension to different stress levels. Using a double-crystal diffractometer with self-compensation of wave-length dispersion and practically negligible instrumental line-broadening, the {\{}002{\}} Bragg reflections were investigated. The broadened diffraction profiles of the deformed crystals were markedly asymmetric and could be resolved into two well-behaved (symmetrical) sub-profiles. The latter could be assigned in a straight-forward manner to the alternating regions of high and low local dislocation density, i.e. to the cell walls and to the cell interiors. The analysis of the sub-profiles permitted the determination of the local dislocation densities and the description of the local dislocation arrangements in terms of a parameter which characterizes the screening of the strain fields of neighbouring dislocations. It is found, in conformity with transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observations, that the character of the overall dislocation distribution varies with increasing deformation and that the principle of similitude is not obeyed. From the X-ray line-broadening data overall dislocation densities were obtained which agree well with values obtained by other authors using TEM. The results of the present study are discussed and compared with published work based mainly on TEM and on measurements of stored energy. ?? 1984.},

The submicron grain-size state of the two refractory metals was produced by the method of high-pressure torsion with different pressure values of 2 and 4 GPa for Nb, and 4 and 8 GPa for Ta, and two different deformations of 0.25 and 1.5 rotations, respectively, with equivalent strains of up to ???40. The dislocation density and the grain size were determined by high-resolution diffraction peak-profile analysis. The beam size on the specimen surface was 0.2 ?? 1 mm, allowing the sub-structure along the radius of the specimen to be characterized. The strength of the two metals was correlated with the dislocation density and the grain size. It is found that, though the grain size is well below 100 nm, the role of dislocations in the flow stress of these two metals is significantly greater than that of the grain size. ?? 2012 Acta Materialia Inc.

abstract = {The dislocation density evolution along the loading axis of a textured AA 7020-T6 aluminum alloy during uniaxial tension was investigated by in-situ synchrotron diffraction. The highly parallel synchrotron beam at the High Energy Materials Science beamline P07 in PETRA III, DESY, offers excellent conditions to separate different influences for line broadening from which micro-strains are obtained using the modified Williamson-Hall method which is also for defect density investigations. During tensile loading the dislocation density evolution was documented from the as-received material (initial micro-strain state) to the relaxation of the strains during elastic deformation. After yield, the increasing rate of dislocation density growth was relatively fast till half-way between yield and UTS. After that, the rate started to decrease and the dislocation density fluctuated as the elongation increased due to the generation and annihilation of dislocations. When dislocation generation is dominant, the correlation between the flow stress and dislocation density satisfies the Taylor equation. Besides, a method to correct the thickness effect on peak broadening is developed in the present study.},

abstract = {A range of diffraction peak profile analysis (DPPA) techniques were used to determine details of the microstructure of plastically deformed alloys. Four different alloys were deformed by uniaxial tension and compression to a range of strains. The methods we have considered include, the full-width, Williamson-Hall methods, Warren-Averbach methods, and van Berkum's alternative method. Different metals were chosen to understand the effect of the deformation microstructure and crystal structure, a nickel alloy, two stainless steel alloys and two titanium alloys. The dislocation density values found by Williamson-Hall and Warren-Averbach methods were found to be close to those expected from TEM results of similar metals. When using the Warren-Averbach methods the results suggest that systematic errors in the dislocation density are introduced by three main factors: (1) separation of instrumental broadening, (2) separation of size and strain broadening, and (3) separation of dislocation density and arrangement. Which suggests in many cases the simpler Williamson-Hall method may be preferable. The other main parameters that can be determined by DPPA are the crystal size and the dislocation arrangement.

abstract = {The microstructure and the dislocation density in as-quenched ferrous lath martensite were studied by different methods. The blocks, packets and variants formed due to martensitic transformation were identified and their sizes were determined by electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD). Concomitant transmission electron microscopy (TEM) investigation revealed that the laths contain subgrains with the size between 50 and 100nm. A novel evaluation procedure of EBSD images was elaborated for the determination of the density and the space distribution of geometrically necessary dislocations from the misorientation distribution. The total dislocation density obtained by X-ray diffraction line profile analysis was in good agreement with the value determined by EBSD, indicating that the majority of dislocations formed due to martensitic transformation during quenching are geometrically necessary dislocations.},

The latter is discussed in terms of different strain types, also accounting for strain field anisotropy and grain boundary effects. The results can in addition be directly read in terms of traditional line profile analysis, such as that based on the Warren-Averbach method.},

abstract = {Interstitial free steel with ultrafine-grained (UFG) structure was prepared by high-pressure torsion (HPT). The development of the microstructure as a function of the number of HPT turns was studied at the centre, half-radius and periphery of the HPT-processed disks by X-ray line profile analysis (XLPA), positron annihilation spectroscopy (PAS) and electron microscopy. The dislocation densities and the dislocation cell sizes determined by XLPA were found to be in good agreement with those obtained by PAS. The evolution of the dislocation density, the dislocation cell and grain sizes, the vacancy cluster size, as well as the high-angle grain boundary (HAGB) fraction was determined as a function of the equivalent strain. It was found that first the dislocation density saturated, then the dislocation cell size reached its minimum value and finally the grain size got saturated. For very high strains after the saturation of grain size the HAGB fraction further increased. The PAS investigations revealed that vacancies introduced by severe plastic deformation agglomerated into small clusters consisting of 9-14 vacancies. The evolution of the yield strength calculated from the microhardness as a function of strain was explained by the development of the defect structure.},

abstract = {Known since antiquity, ball lightning is a natural, long-lived plasma-like phenomenon associated with thunderstorms and is not well understood due to its rarity and unpredictability. A recently discovered laboratory phenomenon with striking similarity to ball lightning is observed when a high-power spark is discharged from a cathode protruding from a grounded electrolyte solution. Whereas several investigations of these long-lived plasmas have been reported over the past decade, the underlying chemical and physical processes are still unknown. The present work attempts to gain further insight into this phenomenon by examining the effect of electrolyte pH on the plasmoid and observing the chemical and physical structure of the plasmoid using high-speed schlieren videography and FTIR absorption spectroscopy. The results indicate that the lifetime and size of the plasmoid slightly increase as the pH of isoohmic electrolyte solutions deviate from neutrality. The observed absorption spectra of the plasmoids exhibit absorption cross sections in the 620-700, 1500-1560, 2280-2390, and 3650-4000 cm(-1) ranges, the last attributed to the presence of water clusters. Finally, schlieren images revealed a single, sharp density gradient at the boundary layer of the top and sides of the expanding ball-shaped plasmoid, and turbulent mixing below the ball.},

@article{Randau2011,
abstract = {Modern materials science diffractometers are generally equipped with area detectors that allow a high time efficiency to be achieved by simultaneously collecting the scattering pattern over large angular regions. These area-detector-based instruments, however, produce a huge amount of data, especially if they are located at large-scale neutron or synchrotron sources. The software StressTextureCalculator (STeCa) was designed to facilitate fast, easy and automated access to such area-detector data. Its outstanding features are direct calculation of diffraction patterns from different types of area-detector measurements, automatic data treatment and peak fitting using several implemented fit options. The resulting information on intensity, peak shift and broadening can then be exported into several data formats. These in turn can be used as input for a wide range of texture, stress and microstructure analysis software packages without additional prior treatment.},
